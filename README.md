# Linear-Regression-from-Scratch

A simple implementation of linear regression algorithm in Machine learning in Python Numpy of the Boston dataset given in the sklearn library.

## Optimizing algorithms
The code presents two optimizing algorithms implemented from scratch. These are:
- Gradient Decent : Iterative Learning algorithm that allow you to use a learning rate of your choice
- Normal Equation : Mathematical approach to calculating weights, computation expensive.

Feel free to play with code and introduce enhancements.
